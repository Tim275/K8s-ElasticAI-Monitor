Collecting workspace information

Based on the workspace content, here's a high-level explanation of the application's purpose:

**Purpose:**
This is an AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) application that:

- Monitors Kubernetes cluster logs using Elasticsearch and FluentD
- Uses AI models (via Ollama) to analyze problematic log patterns
- Proactively alerts and suggests fixes via Discord when:
  - Log volume spikes occur
  - Error patterns emerge
  - Potential security incidents are detected
  - Resource usage anomalies appear

**Technologies Used:**

- Elasticsearch 7.17.3 for log aggregation
- Kibana 7.17.3 for visualization
- FluentD for log collection
- Kubernetes 1.24.17
- Ollama with Mistral/Llama models for AI analysis
- Discord for notifications
- Python Flask for the API service

This helps reduce cloud storage costs and enables preventive actions before issues become critical.
